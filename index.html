    <p>Hello! My name is Franco Taiel Almada, and I’m from Santa Fe, Argentina. I’m passionate about technology, and I
      currently work as a cell phone technician in my own business. My goal is to continuously improve in both my
      technical work and programming studies. I am deeply interested in web development and hope to refine my skills in
      both fields as I move forward in my career. Aside from my professional interests, I am an avid soccer fan — both
      playing and watching the game. I also used to enjoy singing and find learning new things exciting. I believe in
      putting in the effort to always better myself and strive to excel in everything I set out to do.</p>
